build ?
-> multiple web requests to server so latency is introduces
perfomance can be better if js into 1 file, css into 1 file  etc

-> codesize ,if we reduce the size it will be good
-> file order dependencies
  use module system,
-> transpilation  (new features to old code )
-> linting

combing files, minimizing, file Order, linting, transpiler
if we have a build all problems will be solved

webpack conventions use only npm not bower
                    use module system (amd, common, es6)

common module -> require()
amd -> define()
es6 export function(){}

CLI -> Config files -> Dev Server -> Loaders -> Production Builds
